## How to contribute

Before following any of the steps to submit, please make yourself familiar with Git and GitHub. For all types of submissions you will need to work with our source files, using Git and submitting pull requests within GitHub. Our site is using Jekyll and we try to keep as much as we can written in Markdown, so it is a plus if you are familiar with that, too.

If you have good content that you'd like to submit, but you're still having trouble, please contact us via our forum. We'll be happy to help you out.

### Writing posts

To contribute to our blog, you'll need to create a post in the \_posts folder. There is a template for posts in the 'templates' folder, but we're following standard Jekyll conventions. The filename should follow the format 'YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md'.

### Reviews, Builds and Guides

Reviews, Builds and Guides are mostly the same as far as submitting them goes. Those are found in the folders with the corresponding name and creating them is similar to posts, but the filename does not need to include the date. There's a template for these in the 'templates' folder as well.

### Including files or images

You can include files or images. Please put those in existing directories and create subdirectories for your submissions in order to keep everything nicely organized.

### Submission guidelines

* Make sure you don't submit any unnecessary files or commits.
* Try not to edit existing files, unless you're making a correction.
* Don't delete anything unless you're replacing it with something better.
* Submit quality content. We'll not accept garbage.
* Optimize your images before upload.
